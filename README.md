![Screenshot](https://github.com/AnubhavChaturvedi-GitHub/languagemodels_ChatBot/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-06-25%20011755.png)

This repository contains a Flask application that integrates a language model to generate responses based on user input.

### Setup

1. **Installation**

   Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

   Install the required Python packages. Assuming your `requirements.txt` includes `Flask` and your language model library (replace `<language-model-library>` with your actual library name):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Running the Application**

   Start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Usage

- Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
- Enter a message in the input box and submit to receive a response generated by the language model.

### Files and Directory Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `templates/`: Directory for HTML templates (`index.html` should be placed here).
- `static/`: Directory for static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript).
- `README.md`: This file documenting the project.

### Application Details

The Flask application (`app.py`) includes routes to handle rendering the main page (`/`) and processing user input (`/process`). User input is sent to a function (`get_response`) that interacts with the language model library (`languagemodels`) to generate a response.

### Screenshots

Include screenshots of your application in action, if applicable.
